# Frameworks

These are some popular CSS frameworks that I included from their respective projects in order to have them all in place for quality evaluation.

Please keep in mind that in current Drupal theme projects versions used may be somewhat different, adjusted for specific Drupal needs, adjusted to authors vision on how theme would be best themed or use some version other than current. There are just many reasons to do so, well out of scope of this document and the main purpose of this repository: to have all leading edge systems at hand for testing, comparison and evaluation.
